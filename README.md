# Documentation

This repository contains all the codes that generated the numerical results (in Section 4) and empirical results (in Section 5) of the paper titled "Estimating Power-law Degree Distributions via Friendship Paradox based Sampling". A detailed discussion of the steps followed in each code is also available in the Reproducibiliy Appendix (pg. 10) of the paper. The real-world datasets we use are from the 2019 study published in Nature Communications by the authors A. Broido and A. Clauset.

# Directions
